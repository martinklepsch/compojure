The [Austin Clojure Group](http://www.meetup.com/Austin-Clojure-Meetup/) has setup a ClickStart on CloudBees. 

A ClickStart sets up the source, Jenkins build and a continuous deployment to the CloudBees PaaS. The ClickStart is one of the fastest ways to setup a Compojure Project.

Note: You will need to create a CloudBees account (takes about a minute) to run the ClickStart. [Signup](https://www.cloudbees.com/signup) to CloudBees if you haven't already. 

Just click on the Deploy on CloudBees button and enter the application name and you should be on your way.
